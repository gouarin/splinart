# Welcome to Splinart.jl documentation!

Splinart.jl is a package used for a tutorial which explains how to do the Julia packaging and automate the process to distribute this package using github.

This is a translation in Julia language of the Python package [splinart](https://github.com/gouarin/splinart/).

A [C++](https://github.com/gouarin/splinart-cpp) version is also available. It uses software manager [pixi](https://prefix.dev) for deployment.

The original idea of splinart is found on the great [invonvergent](https://inconvergent.net) website.

If you want to install Splinart::

```julia
import Pkg
Pkg.add("https://github.com/pnavaro/Splinart.jl")
```


```@index
```
